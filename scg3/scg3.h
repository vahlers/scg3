 *
 * \section sec_architecture Architecture
 *
 * This scene graph library is based on OpenGL 3.2/GLSL 1.5 %Core Profile and C++11.
 * It is primarily intended for educational use in the lectures
 * <em>Computer Graphics and Interaction</em> (MIN-CGI, M.Sc.) and
 * <em>Computergrafik 1</em> (BIN-CG1, B.Sc.) as well as the accompanying exercises
 * at University of Applied Sciences and Arts Hannover.
 *
 * Cf. lecture notes MIN-CGI, chapter 4 (Scene Graphs) or BIN-CG1, chapter 6 (Szenengraphen).
 *
 * The central classes are scg::Viewer, scg::Renderer, scg::Traverser, scg::Node, and scg::Core
 * as well as its sub-classes.
 * The rendering is controlled by Viewer::startMainLoop() and performed by Renderer::render(),
 * Node::render(), Core::render() as well as the render() methods of the appropriate sub-classes.
 *
 * The Names of vertex attributes and uniform variables are defined in the class
 * OGLConstants (file \link src/scg_internals.cpp\endlink ) and in the GLSL structs Light and
 * Material (file \link shaders/blinn_phong_lighting.glsl\endlink ).
 * They can also be found as in attributes and uniform variables in the supplied
 * shaders (folder shaders).
 *
 * \subsection sec_directory Directory structure
 *
 * - src: source code of scene graph base;
 *   all header files are included in \link scg3.h scg3.h\endlink
 * - src_ext: source code of scene graph extensions, e.g., for virtual reality applications;
 *   all header files are included in \link scg3_ext.h scg3_ext.h\endlink
 * - extern: source code of external libraries GLEW, GLM, and stb_image
 * - models: OBJ geometry models (scg3 has a very basic OBJ parser)
 * - shaders: GLSL shader code
 * - textures: JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP texture images (plus a few other file formats supported by stb_image)
 *
 * Models, shaders, and textures are provided for test applications.
 * Real applications should use their own folders independent of the scg3 source directory.
 *
 * \section sec_usage Usage
 *
 * \subsection sec_installation Installation and Linking
 *
 * Prerequisites: OpenGL 3.2 (or higher), GLFW 3.2.0 (or higher)
 * C++ Compiler: GCC 4.6 (or higher), Clang 3.1 (or higher), Visual C++ 11.0 (Visual Studio 2012, or higher)
 *
 * Build of library scg3:
 * Project files for Eclipse (Linux, MacOS and Windows/MinGW), Visual Studio 2012 (Windows),
 * and CMake files (Linux) are provided.
 *

   g++ -L../scg3/DebugMacOS -L/usr/local/lib -o my_prog my_prog.o -lscg3 -lglfw -framework OpenGL -framework Cocoa -framework IOKit -framework CoreVideo\endverbatim
 *
 * Build of application under Windows/MinGW:
 *
 * \verbatim
   g++ -g -c -std=c++11 -I../scg3 my_prog.cpp
   g++ -L../scg3/DebugWindows -o my_prog.exe my_prog.o -lscg3 -lglfw3 -lopengl32 -lgdi32\endverbatim
 *
 * \subsection sec_example Example Application
 *
 * Cf. lecture notes MIN-CGI, chapter 4 (Scene Graphs) or BIN-CG1, chapter 6 (Szenengraphen).
 *
 * \include scg3_minimal_example.cpp
 *
 * See also the more advanced example \link scg3_table_scene_example.cpp scg3_table_scene_example.cpp\endlink
 * (folder doc) and the supplied shaders (folder shaders).
 *
 * \section sec_acknowledgements Acknowledgments
 *
 * This scene graph implementation utilizes ideas and contributions of Prof. Dr. Henrik Tramberend,
 * Prof. Dr. Frauke Sprengel, Jan Gericke, Bastian Hellmann, Benedikt K&ouml;hler,
 * Alexander Schulz, and Marcus Wichelmann.
 *
 * It is further influenced by the open-source scene graph libraries
 * OpenSceneGraph and OpenSG.
 *
 * https://www.openscenegraph.org/
 *
 * https://www.opensg.org/
 *
 * The open-source libraries GLEW 2.1.0, Glad 0.1.36, GLFW 3.2.0 (or newer), GLM 1.0.0.0, and stb_image 2.21 are used.
 * GLEW, Glad (experimental), GLM, and stb_image are included as source code in folder extern.
 * GLFW 3.2.0 (or newer) has to be installed by the user (cf. https://www.glfw.org/).
