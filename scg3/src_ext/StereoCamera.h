/**
 * \brief A perspective stereo camera (composite node).
 *
 * Experimental: Does not work with multiple render passes
 *               since eye is switched with each call of render().
 *
 * Initial parameters (Bourke method):\n
 * - eye factor: -1 (left eye, direction of eye shift on x-axis)\n
 * - vertical field of view: 60 deg\n
 * - near distance: 0.01\n
 * - far distance: 1000.0\n
 * - screen distance: 1.5\n
 * - ratio interocular distance / screen distance: 0.02\n
